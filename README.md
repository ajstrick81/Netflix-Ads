Block, Bypass, Filter Netflix Ads using AdGuard 

agp file will work in the AdGuard Premium app on Onn Plus TV device. It might work for phones and PCs, but I'm still testing

###Important - Add these rules to the ad blocking user rules section only###


Update: It is extremely difficult to block ALL ads on the Netflix App due to them serving ads from the same domain as their content. This list is not going to 100% block the ads, but it will (hopefully) reduce telemetry and unnecessary domains pinging your device.

Update 2: This has been a humbling experience. It turns out the more aggressive you are with blocking ads, the more the server will push ads through your device. This is an updated approach to reduce/suppress ads, but I haven't been able to eliminate them entirely. Any suggestions are welcome!
